# 😊 Facial Emotion Recognition (FER)

A deep learning-based system that detects human emotions from facial images. This project leverages computer vision and neural networks to classify expressions such as **happiness**, **sadness**, **anger**, **fear**, **surprise**, and **neutrality**.

## 🚀 Features

- 📸 Input: Static facial images
- 🎯 Output: Predicted emotion class
- 🧠 Model: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- 🔍 Preprocessing: Face detection, grayscale conversion, resizing
- 📊 Metrics: Accuracy, confusion matrix, real-time inference support

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch *(choose your framework)*
- NumPy, Matplotlib
- (Optional) Streamlit for UI demo
